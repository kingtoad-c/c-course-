Before starting the course, make sure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of programming concepts (preferably from another language like Python, Java, or C).
- A C++ compiler installed on your system (such as GCC, Clang, or MinGW).
- A text editor or IDE for writing C++ code (such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up Your C++ Development Environment

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to set up a C++ development environment on your system:

### For Windows:
1. **Install MinGW or Microsoft Visual C++**.
2. **Download an IDE** like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio.
3. Write and run your first program in the IDE.

### For Linux/macOS:
1. **Install GCC** using the following commands:
   - **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
   - **macOS**: `brew install gcc`
2. **Use a text editor** such as VS Code or Sublime Text to write your C++ programs.
3. **Compile and run** your C++ programs using the terminal:
   - `g++ program.cpp -o program`
   - `./program`

## üíª Example Program

Here's a simple example to get you started with C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, C++ World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
